# Tanglemonitor

> **IMPORTANT:** Tanglemonitor is now part of the EDF funded **UNIO project**. Hence, you are able to run your own instances. The goal of UNIO is, to combine three well established Tangle analytics tools (tangle.glumb, tanglebeat & tanglemonitor) into one collaborating project. For more details on this, please see the **annoucement** and our **proposal document**. Fully open sourcing Tanglemonitor and providing following instructions is just one of the first steps of our combined efforts project. Later on, we will provide a single repository with detailed instructions and a simple deployment process. For now however, if you like to deploy Tanglemonitor check it out on our new UNIO repository: [https://github.com/unioproject/tanglemonitor](https://github.com/unioproject/tanglemonitor).

This repository is **deprecated** and will be **continued** as part of the **UNIO project** on [https://github.com/unioproject/tanglemonitor](https://github.com/unioproject/tanglemonitor)
